This was written during my 3rd week at Coding Dojo. When executed, the selector changes its width and position to match the width and position of the selected element.  The parens div in the example below is the animated selector.  As written, requires the following unordered list structure for proper execution:

    <ul>
      <div id="parens">
        <div id='parenL'></div>
        <div id='parenM'></div>
      </div>
      <li>
        <h3><a>Link</a></h3>
      </li>
        ...
    </ul>
