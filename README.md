This was written during my 3rd week at Coding Dojo.  I intentionally wrote this with as little JQuery as possible 
to try and learn about how JQuery makes elements move.  The parens div in the example below is the animated selector.

As written, requires the following unordered list structure for proper execution:

    <ul>
      <div id="parens">
        <div id='parenL'></div>
        <div id='parenM'></div>
      </div>
      <li>
        <h3><a>Link</a></h3>
      </li>
        ...
    </ul>
